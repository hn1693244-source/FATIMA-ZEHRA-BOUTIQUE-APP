# Stenography Theory: Complete Chord Reference

## Steno Keyboard Layout

```
Left Hand (Consonants)      Vowels          Right Hand (Consonants)
S T P K W H               A O E U          F R P B L G T S D Z
  S T P K W H           * A O E U *        F R P B L G T S D Z
```

The asterisks (*) represent the vowel keys pressed simultaneously with consonants.

## Chord Structure: Left to Right

Stenography chords flow left to right:
1. **Left consonants** (S T P K W H)
2. **Vowels** (A O E U - center)
3. **Right consonants** (F R P B L G T S D Z)

**Example: "HELLO"**
- H E L O = H (left) + E (vowel) + L O (right)

## Left Hand Consonants (Initial Sounds)

| Key | Sound | Examples |
|-----|-------|----------|
| S | /s/ | SAT, SIT, STENO |
| T | /t/ | TAX, TESTIFY, TRANS |
| P | /p/ | PLAINTIFF, PROVE |
| K | /k/ | COURT, COMPLAINT, CASE |
| W | /w/ | WILL, WITH, WITNESS |
| H | /h/ | HAVE, HEARING, HER |

**Combinations:**
- ST = /st/ (STATUTE)
- SK = /sk/ (SKILL)
- KW = /kw/ (QUESTION)
- STR = Not possible in steno (use briefs)

## Vowel System (Center Keys)

| Key | Sound | Examples |
|-----|-------|----------|
| A | /æ/ | CAT, LAW, DEFENDANT |
| O | /ɔ/ | COURT, THOUGHT, STRONG |
| E | /ɛ/ | TEST, EVIDENCE, BETTER |
| U | /u/ | SUIT, TRUTH, TRUTH |

**Diphthongs & Vowel Combinations:**
- AE = /eɪ/ (CASE, TESTIMONY)
- OE = /oʊ/ (KNOW, CLOSE)
- AU = /aʊ/ (ABOUT, OUT)
- EU = /u/ (SUIT, TRUTH)
- AO = /aɪ/ (SIGN, TRIAL)
- AI = /aɪ/ (TRIED, DENIED)

## Right Hand Consonants (Final Sounds)

| Key | Sound | Examples |
|-----|-------|----------|
| F | /f/ | CHIEF, SELF, BRIEF |
| R | /r/ | COURT, HEAR, ATTORNEY |
| P | /p/ | KEEP, STEP, SKIP |
| B | /b/ | DESCRIBE, JUDGE, CLUB |
| L | /l/ | TRIAL, LEGAL, WILL |
| G | /g/ | HUNG, STRONG, JUG |
| T | /t/ | COURT, STATEMENT, JUST |
| S | /s/ | WITNESS, CASE, JUST |
| D | /d/ | STATED, DENIED, RECORD |
| Z | /z/ | EMPHASIZES, RECOGNIZES |

## Common Legal Chords

### Court Procedures

| Phrase | Chord | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| COURT | KO RT | Fundamental |
| JUDGE | JUJ | Common brief |
| WITNESS | WIT NS | Common brief |
| TRIAL | TRAUL | Standard |
| CASE | KASE | Standard |
| TESTIMONY | TEST MON E | Multi-stroke |
| PLAINTIFF | PLANT F | Standard |
| DEFENDANT | DEF DANT | Standard |

### Legal Terminology

| Term | Example Chord | Usage |
|------|---------------|-------|
| ATTORNEY | THORN E | Legal profession |
| EVIDENCE | EVD NS | Trial procedures |
| JURISDICTION | JUR DK | Legal authority |
| STATUTE | STAT UT | Legal references |
| COMPLAINT | KOPLAINT | Court document |
| DEPOSITION | DEP SITION | Legal procedure |
| OBJECTION | OBJ K SH UN | Trial interjection |
| SUSTAIN | SUS TANE | Judge's ruling |
| OVERRULE | O VER RULE | Judge's ruling |

## Disambiguation Rules

When multiple words share the same chord:

1. **Context determines meaning** - Steno software uses context
2. **Add distinguishing chords** - Use unique patterns
3. **Create conflict briefs** - Define alternatives
4. **Use multiple strokes** - Break into smaller chords

**Example: "OF" vs "OFF"**
- OF = OVF (standard)
- OFF = OF (steno creates distinction)

## Number System

Steno uses number keys for digits:

```
S T P K W H         F R P B L G T S D Z
1 2 3 4 5 6         7 8 9 *, *, *, *, *, *, *
```

**Numbers:**
- 1 = S
- 2 = T
- 3 = P
- 4 = K
- 5 = W
- 6 = H
- 7 = F
- 8 = R
- 9 = P
- 0 = Z

## Vowel Variations & Special Sounds

### Schwa (Neutral Vowel)
Used for unstressed syllables - represented by single vowel or combination

### Consonant Clusters
- Cannot be represented in single stroke
- Use multiple strokes or briefs
- Example: "STRENGTH" = STR ENGTH (multiple strokes)

### Silent Letters
- Generally ignored in steno
- Example: "KNIGHT" = NIGHT (no K sound)

## Practice Progression

1. **Single consonants**: S T P K W H F R B L G D
2. **Vowel + consonant**: AT, IS, ON, UP
3. **Consonant + vowel + consonant**: CAT, DOG, CASE
4. **Multi-stroke words**: TESTIMONY, JURISDICTION
5. **Briefs and shortcuts**: Common legal terms

## Speed Development Through Theory

- **Week 1**: Learn basic chords
- **Week 2**: Practice common words (AT, IS, THE, AND)
- **Week 3**: Add legal terms (COURT, JUDGE, TRIAL)
- **Week 4**: Combine into phrases
- **Week 5+**: Build speed and accuracy

**Key Concept**: Steno is pattern-based. Once you understand the chord structure, you can predict how most words are written. Use this reference to build muscle memory and speed.
