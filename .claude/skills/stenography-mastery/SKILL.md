# Stenography Mastery: Court Reporting & Legal Transcription

Build professional court reporting stenography projects from fundamentals to expert proficiency.

## Quick Start: Court Reporting Basics

Court reporting stenography requires:
- **Speed**: 200+ WPM for real-time transcription
- **Accuracy**: Verbatim transcripts for legal records
- **Specialization**: Legal terminology and procedural knowledge
- **Ergonomics**: Extended sessions without hand strain

### Essential Equipment

**Steno Machine Options:**
- **Mechanical**: Professional machines (Stenotype) - most common in courts
- **Open Source**: Stentura, open-source hardware (budget-friendly)
- **Digital**: Hybrid machines with computer integration

**Software (Most Common: Plover)**
- Free, open-source steno software
- Supports CAT (Computer-Aided Transcription)
- Customizable dictionaries for legal terminology
- Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)

### The Steno Chord System

Stenography uses **simultaneous key presses** (chords) instead of sequential typing:

```
Example chords:
- "THE" = T H (single chord)
- "HELLO" = H E L O (multiple chords)
- "COURT" = K O R T (one chord)
```

**Chord Structure:**
- Left hand: Consonants (STPKWHRAO)
- Right hand: Consonants (FRPBLGTSDZ)
- Vowels: A, O, E, U (center keys)

## Building Court Reporting Projects

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Learn steno theory:**
- See `references/steno-theory.md` for chord mapping
- Practice basic letter combinations
- Build muscle memory for common patterns

**Set up your environment:**
- Install Plover and configure for Windows/Mac/Linux
- Load starter dictionary (default or customized)
- Practice 30-50 WPM drills

**Tools needed:**
- Text editor for note-taking
- Steno practice software
- Dictionary reference files

### Phase 2: Legal Specialization (Weeks 5-12)

**Develop legal vocabulary:**
- See `references/legal-dictionary-guide.md` for legal terminology
- Create custom briefs for common legal phrases
- Practice court terminology and procedure words

**Speed building:**
- Reach 80-120 WPM with accuracy
- Practice real court transcripts (non-sensitive)
- Build speed on legal-specific material

**Dictionary optimization:**
- See `references/dictionary-optimization.md` for techniques
- Add specialized legal briefs
- Remove or modify conflicting entries

### Phase 3: Professional Mastery (Weeks 13+)

**Real-world applications:**
- Transcribe actual court proceedings
- Handle multiple speakers and interruptions
- Manage stress and long sessions

**Advanced workflows:**
- Use CAT software for real-time translation
- Implement scoping techniques for complex cases
- Create client-specific dictionaries

**Continuous improvement:**
- Analyze error logs and common mistakes
- Update dictionaries based on real usage
- Specialize in specific legal domains (civil, criminal, family law)

## Speed Building Progression

**Target milestones:**
- **50 WPM**: Basic sentences with occasional errors
- **100 WPM**: Smooth court testimony at normal pace
- **150 WPM**: Handle fast speakers, maintain accuracy
- **200+ WPM**: Professional court reporting standard

**Practice strategy:**
1. Dictation drills (5-10 minutes daily)
2. Real court transcript practice
3. Speed tests and error analysis
4. Specialized legal terminology drills

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Hand/Wrist pain:**
- Use ergonomic steno keyboard positioning
- Take regular breaks
- Practice proper technique (not force)
- See `references/ergonomics-and-health.md`

**Accuracy issues:**
- Review error logs from practice sessions
- Add corrections to dictionary immediately
- Practice slower with perfect accuracy first
- Gradually increase speed

**Legal terminology gaps:**
- Build dictionary incrementally as you encounter new terms
- Use legal reference materials during breaks
- Ask attorneys and judges for clarification
- Document new terms for future reference

**Dictionary conflicts:**
- Maintain clean dictionaries (remove old/unused entries)
- Use consistent stroking patterns
- Test thoroughly before court use
- Keep backup dictionaries

## Tools & Scripts

**Dictionary validator** (`scripts/validate-dictionary.py`):
- Check for conflicts and formatting errors
- Optimize entry organization
- Generate conflict reports

**Speed tracker** (`scripts/speed-tracker.py`):
- Log practice session results
- Generate performance charts
- Identify weak areas

**Legal brief builder** (`scripts/legal-brief-builder.py`):
- Generate new briefs from court transcripts
- Analyze frequency of words/phrases
- Suggest optimization opportunities

## Professional Resources

**Learning materials:**
- Open Steno Project documentation
- NCRA (National Court Reporters Association) resources
- Steno theory textbooks
- Practice court transcripts

**Community:**
- Open Steno Project forums
- Local court reporter associations
- Online steno practice groups
- Mentorship from experienced reporters

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 fundamentals and steno theory
2. Follow the speed building progression
3. Use reference guides as needed during development
4. Utilize provided scripts for tracking and optimization
5. Join the steno community for support and resources
